## Purpose

Interactively review and remove unresolved tray-icon entries from the current user notification-area registry settings.

## What it does

- Reads `HKCU:\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings`.
- Resolves environment variables and known-folder GUID prefixes.
- Excludes `\WindowsApps\` entries from cleanup.
- Shows unresolved entries for user review before deletion.
- Optionally exports a registry backup to desktop.
- Requires explicit confirmation (`REMOVE`) before deleting entries.
- Optionally restarts Explorer to refresh the tray.

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1+.
- Write access to `HKCU:\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings`.

## Usage

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\noswi\Desktop\Scripts\Invoke-TrayIconCleanup"
.\Invoke-TrayIconCleanup.ps1
```

## Output

- Candidate list with `Key`, `Name`, and `ResolvedPath` before deletion.
- Backup file path when backup is enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- No candidates shown: no unresolved entries were detected.
- Deletion is skipped unless you type exactly `REMOVE`.
- If tray icons do not refresh, sign out/in or restart Explorer manually.

## Safety

This operation is destructive. Keep the `.reg` backup until you verify results.
